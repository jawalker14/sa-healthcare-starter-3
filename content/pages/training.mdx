# Content Editing & Governance

## Edit flow

- Pages: edit files in `content/pages/*.mdx`.
- Blog posts: add files in `content/posts/*.mdx` with front-matter.
- Practice details: edit `content/data/settings.json` (contacts, hours, social, and locations).

## Multi-location structure

`content/data/settings.json` supports multiple locations under `locations`, e.g.:

```json
{
  "schema": { "hasMultipleLocations": true },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": "pretoria-east",
      "name": "Pretoria East Clinic",
      "telephone": "+27 12 345 6789",
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Health St",
        "city": "Pretoria",
        "province": "Gauteng",
        "postalCode": "0001",
        "country": "ZA"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Governance (HPCSA/POPIA aligned)

- No testimonials, reviews, or patient stories.
- No clinical outcome claims or superiority claims.
- Use plain, factual language about services and qualifications.
- Exclude patient-identifiable information from all content.
- For media inquiries, use the Media page boilerplate.
